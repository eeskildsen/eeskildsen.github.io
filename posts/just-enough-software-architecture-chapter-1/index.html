<p>This series loosely summarizes George Fairbanks&rsquo;s <em>Just Enough Software Architecture: A Risk-Driven Approach</em> as I read through it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Software is getting harder. It may be the most complicated thing humans have ever built. Consequently, we need tools to approach it with.</p>

<h2 id="3-tools-to-approach-software-with">3 Tools To Approach Software With</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Partitioning:</strong> Separate parts of a project. This lets you forget about the details. &ldquo;I have a thousand classes in this project. Let me break it up into 10 libraries.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve solved this problem before.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is close to a pattern I know. Let me use it to help clean up my code.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> When driving from point A to point B, think about the roads, not the fields and parking lots.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-architecture">What Is Architecture?</h2>

<p>Architecture is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A tool that helps you with partitioning, knowledge, and abstraction</li>
<li>&ldquo;Macroscopic design of a software system&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Architecture is <em>not</em> functionality. Systems with different architectures can do the same job.</p>

<p>Example: Rackspace&rsquo;s email logging system. Version 1 was created when they were small. As they grew, they developed version 2, then version 3. Different architectures, same functionality.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Version 1:</strong> Log files lived locally on the email servers. There was a tool that <code>ssh</code>ed into the servers to grab the log files and do stuff with them.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2:</strong> The email servers logged to a central database.</li>
<li><strong>Version 3:</strong> The email servers logged to Hadoop Distributed File System.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="quality-attributes-compete">Quality Attributes Compete</h3>

<p>There are tradeoffs. If your architecture is super performant, development may be complicated (cf. native vs. Electron). If it&rsquo;s super scalable, it may not be flexible.</p>

<h3 id="conceptual-models-help">Conceptual Models Help</h3>

<p>A software architect could look at Rackspace&rsquo;s 3 versions and see patterns. This would help them reason about which one is best in a given situation.</p>

<h2 id="abstractions-and-constraints-are-useful">Abstractions and Constraints Are Useful</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easier to think about small problems than big ones. An abstraction such as <em>job</em> helps you understand what something does right away (it runs, it may have a schedule, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="what-s-risk-driven-architecture">What&rsquo;s Risk-Driven Architecture?</h2>

<p>Approaching architecture from the perspective of risk helps you reason about how much is enough and how much is too much.</p>

<p>Example: The author&rsquo;s father has 2 mechanical engineering degrees. But when he put in a mailbox, he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;calculate moments, stresses, and strains.&rdquo; He just stuck it in the ground. Why? Low risk.</p>

<p>In contrast, consider Friendster. They should&rsquo;ve expected high traffic and architected for it. Instead their site got slow, and competitors like MySpace and Facebook beat them.</p>

<p><em>Risk-driven architecture</em> is about choosing just enough architecture for the task at hand. If the only risk can be handled by refactoring, do <em>no</em> architecture.</p>
